### Types of Captcha

We've added support for three types of captcha:

#### Normal Captcha (6-60s)

Works anytime for all types of captchas.

#### Turbo Captcha (2-6s)

Works anytime, only for code drops, requires XSID.

#### Instant Captcha (0-2s)

Works on weekly streams, only for code drops, requires XSID.

### XSID

With an XSID, you only need to manage one credits system, and you can top up your XSID once to use it for all your accounts.

### Settings File

We've added a settings file (`settings.json`) so you can preset your bot before starting it. You can set automatic start, XSID, chat ID (optional), low credits notifications, and more.

### Auto Start

Will load from `accounts.json` after connecting to the server and then start automatically.

### XSID

Put your XSID and auto assign it after connecting to the server.

### Chat ID (optional)

Your telegram group ID for reports (see below).

### Low Credits Notifications

Invite [StakeReloadXS Assistant](https://t.me/srxs_bot) to a telegram group and get the group ID from [Raw Group Info Bot](https://t.me/SimpleID_Bot) to stay up to date with event logs from your accounts.

### Stake Drop & Stake Reload: Instant Captcha

Instant captcha feature can provide your captcha instantly without waiting for captcha providers, the only waiting time is between you and our server.

More About This Feature:

* Requires XSID with instant support to work
* Only available during weekly streams
* Not to be confused with regular captchas
