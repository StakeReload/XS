##### Reporting a Vulnerability #####
#####################################
-StakeReloadXS provides a contact for the reporting of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a bug or security vulnerability, please create a support ticket in our discord, or contact on telegram.
-Please do not forget to include your contact information, a brief description of the bug/vulnerability and steps to reproduce. Video recordings are always helpful when trying to troubleshoot since all users have different systems, configurations, hardwarem, software, operating systems, network conditions, and many other considerations.
-We recommend always using a chromium based browser with the latest up to date commercial releases, as well as keeping your software and hardware up to date. If you are on chromium based browser, please include in your report chrome://version/ and operating system.
-Depending on the severity of the vulnerability there may be a bounty for ethical disclosures, and in such cases, we will assess the report and its priority, and award at our discretion a payment for such disclosures. The more complete information contained in your reports, the more complete and quickly we will be able to address and mitigate risks. We take all reports seriously regardless of the source of the reports and is our top priority for our users safety.
-If you have an idea or suggestion for our services feel free to leave us feedback, and we will get back to you if we need more information for feature requests.
